![Career Mentor Logo](https://i.imgur.com/your-logo-image-url.png) 
This repository contains the source code for the **Career Mentor** mobile application, a prototype developed for the **Google Gen AI Exchange Hackathon**.

## üìñ About the Project

Career Mentor is an intelligent, mobile-first application designed to revolutionize career guidance. It addresses the common challenge faced by students and professionals: navigating a complex job market with generic, one-size-fits-all advice.

The app's key innovation is its use of **Google's Generative AI**. Instead of providing static, pre-written roadmaps, the app analyzes a user's unique profile‚Äîtheir desired job and existing skills‚Äîto generate a dynamic, step-by-step career path in real-time, ensuring the guidance is always relevant, tailored, and up-to-date.
